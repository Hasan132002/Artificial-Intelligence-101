Loops:

For Loop Iteration:

Write a Python program using a for loop to print the squares of numbers from 1 to 5.
While Loop Condition:

Implement a Python program using a while loop to find the factorial of a given number. Ensure proper handling for the case when the input is zero.
Loop Control Statements:

Write a program that uses the break statement in a for loop to find the first even number in a list.
Nested Loop Logic:

Create a Python program using nested loops to print a multiplication table up to 5x5.
Lists:

List Basics:

Write code to initialize an empty list, then append the numbers 1 to 5 to the list. Print the final list.
List Operations:

Implement a Python program that takes a list of numbers and creates a new list with each number squared. Print both the original and modified lists.
List Comprehension:

Rewrite the previous question using list comprehension to create a new list with squared numbers.
List Manipulation:

Write a Python function that removes duplicates from a given list while preserving the order of elements. Test the function with a sample list.
